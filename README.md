## Features

### Add_Book
- User can add new books to the library's collection. Each book has title, author, publish year and unique ISBN.

### Borrow_Book
- Users can borrow a book from the library if it is available. The system keeps track of which books are currently borrowed.

### Return_Book
- User can return borrowed book, making available for others to borrow.

### Available_Books
- The system provides list of currently available books to borrow.

## Technologies_Used

- Java - The main progamming language to develop the system.
- JUnit - Used for unit testing and ensuring the correctness of the system throughout the development process.
- Test-Driven Development - The development approach used to build the system, where tests are written before the actual implementation.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach 

This project follows the TDD approach, which emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. By following this methodology, the system is designed with testing in mind, ensuring robustness and reducing the likelihood of bugs. Each feature of the Library Management System is backed by unit tests written using JUnit, verifying that the feature works as expected.

## Usage
To use the library management system, run the main class in your java IDE or command line. You can interact with the system through the console to add, borrow, return, and view available books.
